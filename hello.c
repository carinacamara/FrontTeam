"Baby Boy" is a song by American singer Beyoncé (pictured) from her 
debut solo studio album Dangerously in Love. Featuring Jamaican rapper 
Sean Paul, the song was released by Columbia Records and Music World 
Entertainment as the second single from the album on August 3, 2003. 
Both artists co-wrote the song with Scott Storch, Robert Waller and 
Jay-Z; Beyoncé also co-produced the song. Containing a lyrical 
interpolation of "No Fear" by hip hop group O.G.C, "Baby Boy" is an R&B 
and dancehall song with reggae and Arabic music influences. The lyrics 
detail a woman's fantasies. The song topped the US Billboard Hot 100 for 
nine consecutive weeks, and was Beyoncé's longest-running solo 
number-one single until 2007, when it was surpassed by "Irreplaceable". 
It reached the top ten in many countries, and was certified platinum in 
Australia and the US. The song's music video was directed by Jake Nava 
and mostly shows Beyoncé dancing in various locations. "Baby Boy" has 
remained a staple of Beyoncé's concert set lists.
